Hi, I'm Alexander Hu, currently studying CS at UCLA

I've worked with C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Shell/Bash, Lisp, R, Verilog, and Emacs Lisp.

My favorite programming projects are those involving automation or scripting. My first programming language was Python. 

I play a lot of chess, so some of my code takes inspiration from or is directly involved with the game.
